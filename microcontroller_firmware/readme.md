# Microcontroller Firmware

This code runs the coprocessor used for the time machine. Basically updating the screens and reading the encoder, communicating with the RPi over hardware UART with USB as a fallback.

Writen in the Arduino framework to be rather portable, originally intended for some bootleg STM32 Blue Pills I had littering my parts drawer.
