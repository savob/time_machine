# RPi Scripts

# Adding Photos

Photos need to be added to a directory in this repository called `time_machine_photos/` with the following naming scheme `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.xxx`. **Currently the script on accepts `.jpg` and `.png` files.**

# Set up 

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependancies (currently just opencv).

Drew a lot of my code from [this Code Project](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5373372/A-DIY-Digital-Picture-Frame-in-Python) with the source repo [here](https://github.com/deangi/digitalFotoFrame). I modified it to remove the periodic sleep feature and changed it to use `snake_case`.
